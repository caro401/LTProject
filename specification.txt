This module shall allow the user to generate random sentences based on text by an author or from a genre of their choice.
The module shall provide a command line interface for the user to interact with.
The user shall choose whether to use a unigram, bigram, trigram or quadrigram  model.
The user shall supply some text, in the form of a text file, to be used as training data for the system.
The system shall contain functionality to randomly generate a sentence based on the n-gram probabilities learned from this training data
It shall also be able to return a specified number of most common words from the text, the history which has the most possible words after it,
and all n-grams that begin with a specified history.

The module consists of three files:
linked_list.py contains a class representing a linked list, and associated sorting, searching, insertion, deletion etc methods, and a class representing a node.
ngrams_list.py contains a class representing an n-gram language model learned from a text file, and the associated methods for providing the specified functionality.
interface.py contains a function to provide a command-line interface to the NGramModel class, for easier interaction.
